    1. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

Features:
Readability and Simplicity: Python's syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward, making it easier for developers to understand and write code.
Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language, meaning code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging easier. There's no need to compile code before running it.
Dynamically Typed: Variables in Python do not need an explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The interpreter automatically detects the type of variable based on the value assigned to it.
Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks, such as file I/O, system calls, and networking. This reduces the need to write code from scratch.

Examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective:
Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask make Python a powerful choice for web development. Django, for example, provides an extensive suite of tools and libraries that simplify the creation of complex web applications.
Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, sci-kit-learn, and TensorFlow make Python a dominant language in data science and machine learning. These libraries provide tools for data manipulation, analysis, and building machine learning models.
Automation and Scripting: Python's simplicity makes it an excellent choice for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks, such as file manipulation, web scraping, and task scheduling.
Scientific Computing: Python is used extensively in scientific research due to libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, which provide capabilities for numerical computations, simulations, and data visualization.

    2. Install Python:
 	  For Debian operating systems
- you first update the system to get Python that is up to date i.e.
      	Sudo apt update 
- After updating the system, you install Python in your machine i.e.
       	sudo apt install python3 python3-pip 
* Verify the Installation:
    • Open a Terminal window.
    • Type python3 --version and press Enter. You should see the Python version number.
    • Check pip3 by typing pip3 –version.

* Set Up a Virtual Environment:
    • Open Terminal.
    • Navigate to your project directory: cd path/to/your/project
    • Create a virtual environment by running: python3 -m venv env
    • Activate the virtual environment:
I.e. source env/bin/activate

    3. print ("Hello, World!")
Explanation of Basic Syntax Elements
    • print: This is a built-in function in Python used to output text or other types of data to the console. Functions in Python are called using their name followed by parentheses.
    • "Hello, World!": This is a string, which is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks. In this case, it's enclosed in double quotes, but you can also use single quotes ('Hello, World!').
    • Parentheses (): The parentheses are used to enclose the arguments of the function. In this case, the argument is the string "Hello, World!".
When you run this program, Python interprets the print function and its argument and then outputs the string to the console.

    4. Basic Data Types in Python
    • Integer (int): Represents whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.
    • Float (float): Represents real numbers, containing one or more decimal points.
    • String (str): Represents sequences of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes.
    • Boolean (bool): Represents one of two values: True or False.
  	Short Script Demonstrating Different Data Types
	age = 25 print ("Age:", age) 
 	Float price = 19.99 print ("Price:", price) 
String name = "Alice" print ("Name:", name) 
Boolean is student = True print ("Is student:", is student)
    5. Conditional statements allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on certain conditions. The primary conditional statements in Python are if, Elif, and else.
Example:
age = 18
if age < 18:
print ("You are a minor.")
elif age == 18:
 print ("You are exactly 18 years old.")
else:
 print ("You are an adult.")
Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. The primary types of loops in Python are for and while loops.
A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range). It executes the block of code for each item in the sequence.
Example:
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"] 
for color in colors: 
print(color)

    6. Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow you to organize and modularize your code, making it more readable, maintainable, and reusable. Functions help in reducing code duplication and enable easier debugging and testing.
Defining a Function
A function is defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses containing any parameters. The code block within the function is indented.
Example:
def function_name(parameters):
 # Block of code
  return value # Optional



A Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

Example of Calling the Function
result = add_numbers(5, 3) 
print ("The sum is:", result)


    7.  Data Structure:
List: An ordered collection of items, which can be of any data type. Items in a list are indexed by their position (starting from 0).
Dictionary: An unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, and keys are used to access the corresponding values.

Syntax:
List: Defined using square brackets [].
Dictionary: Defined using curly braces {} with key-value pairs separated by colons:
Accessing Elements:
List: Access elements by their index.
Dictionary: Access elements by their key.
 	 Mutability:
Both lists and dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can change their contents after creation.

Example:

# Creating a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Creating a dictionary with key-value pairs
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Basic operations on the list
print("Original list:", numbers)

# Adding an element to the list
numbers.append(6)
print("List after appending 6:", numbers)

# Removing an element from the list
numbers.remove(3)
print("List after removing 3:", numbers)

# Accessing an element by index
print("Element at index 2:", numbers[2])

# Slicing the list
print("Sliced list (first 3 elements):", numbers[:3])

# Basic operations on the dictionary
print("\nOriginal dictionary:", person)

# Adding a new key-value pair
person["email"] = "alice@example.com"
print("Dictionary after adding email:", person)

# Updating the value of an existing key
person["age"] = 31
print("Dictionary after updating age:", person)

# Removing a key-value pair
del person["city"]
print("Dictionary after removing city:", person)

# Accessing a value by key
print("Name:", person["name"])

# Iterating over keys and values in the dictionary
print("\nKeys and values in the dictionary:")
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

List Operations
    • Creating a List:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    • Adding an Element:
numbers.append(6)
Adds the element 6 to the end of the list.
    • Removing an Element:
numbers.remove(3)
Removes the first occurrence of the element 3 from the list.
    • Accessing an Element by Index:
numbers [2]
Retrieves the element at index 2 (third element).
    • Slicing the List:
numbers [:3]
Retrieves the first three elements of the list.

Dictionary Operations
    • Creating a Dictionary:
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
    • Adding a New Key-Value Pair:
person["email"] = "alice@example.com"
    • Updating the Value of an Existing Key:
person["age"] = 31
    • Removing a Key-Value Pair:
del person["city"]
    • Accessing a Value by Key:
person["name"]
    • Iterating Over Keys and Values:
for key, value in person.items():
 print(f"{key}: {value}")

    8. Exception handling in Python allows you to manage and respond to runtime errors in a controlled way, preventing the program from crashing. When an error occurs, Python generates an exception, which can be caught and handled using try, except, and finally blocks.
    • Try The block of code to be tested for errors.
    • Except: The block of code to execute if an error occurs in the try block.
    • finally: The block of code to execute regardless of whether an error occurred or not (optional).
Example:
def divide_numbers(a, b):
 try:
 result = a / b
 except ZeroDivisionError:
 print ("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
 result = None
 except TypeError:
  print ("Error: Both arguments must be numbers.")
   result = None
   else:
    print ("Division successful.")
   finally:
   print ("Execution of the divide_numbers function is complete.")
   return result
  # Example usage
    num1 = 10
    num2 = 0
    print (f"Dividing {num1} by {num2}:")
    result = divide_numbers(num1, num2)
    print ("Result:", result)
    print ("\nDividing 10 by 2:")
    result = divide_numbers(10, 2)
    print ("Result:", result)
    print ("\nDividing '10' by 2:")
    result = divide_numbers('10', 2)
    print ("Result:", result)

    9. A module in Python is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py added. Modules allow you to organize your code into manageable and reusable components. A package is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy. A package is a directory containing a special file named __init__.py (which can be empty) along with the modules. Packages allow you to structure your project and group related modules together.
Suppose you have a file named mymodule.py with the following content:
# mymodule.py
def greet(name):
return f"Hello, {name}!"
      def add(a, b):
       return a + b
      You can then import and use this module in another Python script
	Example using math module:
	import math
 	# Using functions from the math module
number = 9
square_root = math.sqrt(number)
print (f"The square root of {number} is {square_root}")
# Using constants from the math module
pi = math.pi
print (f"The value of pi is {pi}")
# Using trigonometric functions
angle = math.radians(45)  # Convert 45 degrees to radians
sin_angle = math.sin(angle)
print (f"The sine of 45 degrees is {sin_angle}")

    10.  Python provides built-in functions to read from and write to files. The primary functions used for these operations are open(), read(), write(), and close(). The with statement is commonly used to handle file operations more safely and cleanly, as it ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.
Script to Read from a File
def read_file(file_path):
 try:
 with open (file_path, 'r') as file:
  content = file.read()
   print(content)
    except FileNotFoundError:
    print (f"The file {file_path} does not exist.")
    except IOError:
    print (f"An error occurred while reading the file {file_path}.")
   # Example usage
   file_path = 'example.txt'
   read_file(file_path)
Script to Write to a File
	def write_to_file(file_path, lines):
    	try:
        	with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
            for line in lines:
            file.write(line + '\n')
        	print(f"Content written to {file_path} successfully.")
    	except IOError:
        	print(f"An error occurred while writing to the file {file_path}.")
# Example usage
file_path = 'output.txt'
lines = ["Hello, world!", "This is a test.", "Writing to a file in Python."]
write_to_file(file_path, lines)
